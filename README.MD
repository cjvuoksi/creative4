Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

The site uses React CLI for the front end
The site uses Node, Express, and Mongo on the back end
The site uses an API between the front end and back end, and supports create, read, update, and delete operations
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
In addition, the site should have a robust data model. Ideally, this should be multiple collections of documents and a detailed schema for each collection. For example, if you were building a recipe site, you could have a collection for recipes and for people. The recipes should have a robust schema, such as name, description, ingredient list, photo. The people should have a robust schema, such as name, interests, favorite recipes, etc.  You want to avoid having an overly simplistic site.
